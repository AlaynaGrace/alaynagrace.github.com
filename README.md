# Weekend 6 HW (Part One) 
## Start a Portfolio

## Objectives
- Angular practice with multiple views, controllers, and a service
- Front end styling
- Hosting with out a database on Heroku

## Instructions

Create a landing page for yourself as a developer. This is mostly front end project, it will have a simple server set up to serve back your static files. Otherwise, the focus will be on angular and front end styling.

## Front End
- Have at least two views
- Write an Angular service to get information from the github API to put on your site.
- Style your site applying any techniques you want from Friday demos.

## Back End
- Write a server file that can server all your static content.
- As practice, comment each line you write. Use only the code you need and make sure you know what each line does.
- You will be deploying this on Heroku, so don't hard code the port.

## Deploy
- Deploy the app on Heroku. It doesn't have a data base so you can follow the same steps as we did in lecture. 

## Submit
- The github url (where the code lives)
- The Heroku url (url of the deployed site)
